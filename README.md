# POG (Power On Gameboy) Regulator
This is a regulator made for Gameboy Colors and Gameboy Pockets that utilize an IPS display kit, this regulator is not compatible with OEM screens. This regulator outputs 5Vs only.


# Ordering
At the moment I will only be sharing the project(s) on PCBWay. I will continue adding different variations of the regulator as shared projects when I have the time to do so. The regulator can be ordered in any thickness. My preference is usually 1mm, but the standard 1.6mm will be fine.
You will need to be proficient at soldering surface mounted components unless you opt for PCBWay to build your regulator for you.
